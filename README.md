## Project 7: Real Time Character Counter [18 May]

It aims to create a real-time character counter using JavaScript. It features a text area container that displays both the total character count and remaining character count of 280(like Twitter). As users type, the total character count dynamically increases, and the remaining character count decreases. The text area locks once the limit of 50 characters is reached, and the remaining character count becomes zero. With this functionality, users can keep track of their remaining characters and be alerted when they hit the character limit

This information is dynamically retrieved using JavaScript, ensuring that the page always displays the current date. For example, if viewed in December 2021, the page will display December 2nd, which is a Thursday. By creating this mini calendar, you will learn how to retrieve and display current date information using JavaScript.
